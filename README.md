G-BSSN Solver for Einstein Equation
===================================

This is the source code for a solver for generalized BSSN formulation of
Einstein's equation in spherical symmetry in compactified non-uniform grid.

This is the first successful implementation of a fully evolutionary scheme
that can track and find the critical solution. See the publication: <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.01614v2.pdf>



Requirements
------------

- C and FORTRAN compilers
- Maple
- FD Toolkit [[+]](http://rmanak.github.io/FD)
- GRTensor [[+]](http://grtensor.phy.queensu.ca/) for computing BSSN formulation
- bbhutil/SDF libraries (for I/O and driver) part of librnpl [[+]](http://laplace.phas.ubc.ca/People/arman/files/RNPL\_ref.pdf)


Workflow Sample
---------------

See ``compile_run_workflow.sh`` for an example of a compilation and run

Source Code
-----------

See ``src/FD`` for all of calculation codes generated by FD Toolkit.

See ``src/human`` for some quick utility codes written by human.


Finite Difference Process:
--------------------------

See the ``gen_codes.sh`` for the flow of code generation and from there see
each files that are used.

See ``main.mpl`` for the major parts of calculation and finite differencing and
from there see each files that are used.
